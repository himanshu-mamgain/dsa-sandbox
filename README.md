# DSA By Doing

DSA By Doing is a hands-on learning playground designed to help you understand Data Structures and Algorithms by building and interacting with real-world systems. Unlike traditional theory-first approaches or interview drill sites, "DSA By Doing" focuses on **tangible implementation** and **visual feedback**. You learn by seeing structures work, break, and evolve.
